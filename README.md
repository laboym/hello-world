# hello-world
Creating my first Git Repository. Test
This is my first real experience with github on a personal level. 
I'm enjoying running through these lessons.
I'm not going to lie, it makes me feel kind of smart sometimes. 
Not everyone takes the interest in this that I do or has the patience for it
In all honesty, neither do I.
But I like that,
that's all for now. Thanks for listening;
reading.
